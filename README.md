### Algorithms & Sorts: 

1. [Binary search](https://github.com/hakloi/python_portfolio/blob/main/practice/algorithms/binary_search.py) - 
 is an algorithm with _O(log n)_ time that is used to find the position of an item in a sorted array. 
2. [Selection sort - ascending/descending](https://github.com/hakloi/python_portfolio/blob/main/practice/algorithms/selection_sort.py) -
is an algorithm _O(n^2)_ that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
3. [Recursion](https://github.com/hakloi/python_portfolio/blob/main/practice/algorithms/recursion.py) -  is when a function calls itself. Also it uses stack. The stack is a simple data structure. Recursion is __VERY IMPORTANT__ for functional language like Haskell that doesn't have a loop.
4. [Quicksort](https://github.com/hakloi/python_portfolio/blob/main/practice/algorithms/quicksort.py) - 
is a sorting algorithm with O(n*log n) time.
5. Merge sort - 
the constant in Big O notation can matter sometimes. Thatâ€™s why quicksort is faster than merge sort
