### Algorithms: 

1. [Binary search](https://github.com/hakloi/python_portfolio/blob/main/practice/algorithms/binary_search.py) - 
 is an algorithm with _O(log n)_ time that is used to find the position of an item in a sorted array. 
2. [Selection sort - ascending/descending](https://github.com/hakloi/python_portfolio/blob/main/practice/algorithms/selection_sort.py) -
is an algorithm _O(n^2)_ that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.


The stack is a simple data structure.
